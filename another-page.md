## _Facebook Users Across The World_ Project

### Description

In this personal project, I wanted to see which countries/regions had the most Facebook users. To do this, I downloaded a data set from Kaggle user Muhammad Faisal Ali called ```data.csv``` which contained data that was collected between November, 20 2020 and May, 31 2021. Within this data set were the colums ```Name, Users, Facebook_Users%, Data_of_Data_ and Population```. the main purpose of finding which countries/regions had the most Facebook users was to discover the places that busineses should target in order to get the most reach with their ads, posts, etc.

### Conclusion

From my visualization, I made a few valuable discovery that would assist businesses in deciding what countries to target. First, the top five countries with the most users are ```India(416.6M), the United States(240M), Indonesia(176.5M), Brazil(139M)```, and the ```Philiphines(91M)```. Knowing this, it would be wise for a business to focus on these countries when putting ads, post, etc. on Facebook becuase these countries would result in the most reach.
