## Insurance Analysis 

In this personal project I analyzed the data set _insurance.csv_ which I found on Kaggle from the user Alexis Cook. The purpose of this analysis was to discover if the following claims were correct or incorrect: baby boomers pay more for health insurance compared to millenials and gen x, baby boomers have a higher BMI(Body Mass Index) causing their health insurance to be more, and on average the number of baby boomers that smoke is greater than the other two groups, millenials and gen x.
