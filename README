#AGE
# claim: older people pay more health insurance
# find max and min ages using max() and min() functions

max(insurance$age)
min(insurance$age)

# discovery: oldest age is 64 and youngest is 18
# age will be divided by Millenials(18-34), Gen_X(35-50), Baby_Boomers(51-64) using subset() function

Millenials = subset(insurance, age <=34)
Gen_X = subset(insurance, age >34 & age < 50)
Baby_Boomers = subset(insurance, age >51)

# find which group on average pays the most using mean() function

mean(Millenials$charges)
mean(Gen_X$charges)
mean(Baby_Boomers$charges)

# discovery: on average Baby_Boomers pay the most at 18,298.07, Millenials pay the least amount at 9,673.32, and Gen_X sits in the middle at 13,744.29


#BMI
# claim: Baby_Boomers have higher avergae bmi thus making insurance more
# we can find this by again using the mean() function

mean(Millenials$bmi)
mean(Gen_X$bmi)
mean(Baby_Boomers$bmi)

# discovery: on avergae Baby_Boomers have highest bmi at 31.70, Millenials have lowest at 30.05, and Gen_X sits again in the middle at 30.55

#SMOKER
# claim: on average Baby_Boomers smoke more than Gen_x and Millenials
# smoker column includes "yes" and "no" so lets count the yes's in each group using count() function

count(Millenials,smoker, sort = TRUE)
count(Gen_X,smoker,sort = TRUE)
count(Baby_Boomers,smoker,sort = TRUE)

# discovery: Millenials "yes" = 116, Gen_x "yes" = 90, Baby_Boomers "yes" = 58

#CLAIMS: 
#older people pay more health insurance
#Baby_Boomers have higher avergae bmi thus making insurance more
#on average Baby_Boomers smoke more than Gen_x and Millenials

#DISOVERIES:
#on average Baby_Boomers pay the most at 18,298.07, Millenials pay the least amount at 9,673.32, and Gen_X sits in the middle at 13,744.29
#on avergae Baby_Boomers have highest bmi at 31.70, Millenials have lowest at 30.05, and Gen_X sits again in the middle at 30.55
#Millenials "yes" = 116, Gen_x "yes" = 90, Baby_Boomers "yes" = 58 meaning Millenials smoke the most
